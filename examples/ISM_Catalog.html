                     <p>The purpose of the <a href="#5b5e987e-5373-4392-9c6c-33d6d668eb1f">Australian Government Information Security Manual</a> (ISM) is to outline a cyber security framework that organisations can apply, using
                        their risk management framework, to protect their systems and data from cyber threats.</p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="UNKNOWN subsection"><span class="tag">subsection: </span><p class="UNKNOWN subsectiontext"><span class="tag">subsectiontext: </span>Intended audience</p>
                     <p>The ISM is intended for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), Chief Information
                        Officers (CIOs), cyber security professionals and information technology managers.</p>

                     <p>The ISM represents the considered advice of the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)
                        within the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). This advice is provided in accordance
                        with ASD’s designated functions under section 7(1)(ca) of the <a href="#494665b5-c168-49ba-9395-bd543eb3c81f">Intelligence Services Act 2001</a>.</p>
                     <p>The ACSC also provides cyber security advice in the form of consumer guides, Australian
                        Communications Security Instructions and other cyber security-related publications.
                        In these cases, device and application-specific advice may take precedence over the
                        advice in the ISM.</p>

                     <p>Organisations are not required as a matter of law to comply with the ISM, unless legislation,
                        or a direction given under legislation or by some other lawful authority, compels
                        them to comply. Furthermore, the ISM does not override any obligations imposed by
                        legislation or law. Finally, if the ISM conflicts with legislation or law, the latter
                        takes precedence.</p>
                     <p>While the ISM contains examples of when legislation or laws may be relevant for organisations,
                        there is no comprehensive consideration of such issues. When designing, operating
                        and decommissioning systems, organisations are encouraged to familiarise themselves
                        with legislation such as the <a href="#bb7950b8-e345-4024-adf4-55f30cfc233b">Archives Act 1983</a>, <a href="#a3d09516-f5b6-48ad-99bb-e14ad6916ce9">Privacy Act 1988</a> and <a href="#f0b5a766-fb46-4a50-b7a9-4a0544eb2296">Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979</a>.</p>

                     <p>The purpose of the cyber security principles within the ISM is to provide strategic
                        guidance on how organisations can protect their systems and data from cyber threats.
                        These cyber security principles are grouped into four key activities: govern, protect,
                        detect and respond. Organisations should be able to demonstrate that the cyber security

                        guidance on how organisations can protect their systems and data from cyber threats.
                        These cyber security guidelines cover governance, physical security, personnel security,
                        and information and communications technology security matters. Organisations should
                        consider the cyber security guidelines that are relevant to each of the systems that
                        they operate.</p>

                     <p>The risk management framework used by the ISM draws from National Institute of Standards
                        and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37 Rev. 2, <a href="#212c62d8-015d-4d60-921f-15ef675d993c">Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life
                           Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy</a>. Within this risk management framework, the identification of security risks and
                        selection of security controls can be undertaken using a variety of risk management
                        standards, such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 31000:2018,
                        <a href="#53cc9fa4-5581-421d-ab99-997797cb5d86">Risk management – Guidelines</a>. Broadly, the risk management framework used by the ISM has six steps: define the
                        system, select security controls, implement security controls, assess security controls,
                        authorise the system and monitor the system.</p>

                        of the impact if it were to be compromised.</p>
                     <p>When embarking upon the design of a system, the type, value and security objectives
                        for the system, based on confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements,
                        should be determined. This will ultimately guide activities such as selecting and
                        tailoring security controls to meet those security objectives and determining the
                        level of residual risk that will be accepted before the system is authorised to operate.</p>
                     <p>For organisations that handle government data, the Attorney-General’s Department (AGD)’s
                        <a href="#99428c73-4440-437d-9b48-baefafaff215">Protective Security Policy Framework</a> (PSPF), <a href="#a5bb071a-087b-470d-8630-a255101191b3">Sensitive and classified information</a> policy can assist in determining the value of data, and its associated protective
                        markings, based on the potential impact of its compromise.</p>
                     <p>For organisations that do not handle government data, security controls marked as
                        OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL: Sensitive can be used for a suitable level of protection.</p>
                     <p>Following the determination of the type and value of a system, along with its security
                        objectives, a description of the system and its characteristics should be documented
                        in the system’s system security plan.</p>

                  <p class="UNKNOWN subsection"><span class="tag">subsection: </span><p class="UNKNOWN subsectiontext"><span class="tag">subsectiontext: </span>Select security controls</p>
                     <p>Select security controls for the system and tailor them to achieve desired security
                        objectives.</p>
                     <p>Each cyber security guideline discusses security risks associated with the topic it
                        covers. Paired with these discussions are security controls that the ACSC considers
                        to provide efficient and effective mitigations based on the security objectives for
                        a system.</p>
                     <p>While security risks and security controls are discussed in the cyber security guidelines,
                        and act as a security control baseline, these should not be considered an exhaustive
                        list for a specific activity or technology. As such, the cyber security guidelines
                        provide an important input into each organisation’s risk identification and risk treatment
                        activities however do not represent the full extent of such activities.</p>
                     <p>While the cyber security guidelines can assist with risk identification and risk treatment
                        activities, organisations will still need to undertake their own risk analysis and
                        risk evaluation activities due to the unique nature of each system, its operating
                        environment and the organisation’s risk tolerances.</p>
                     <p>Following the selection and tailoring of security controls for a system, they should
                        be recorded along with the details of their planned implementation in the system’s
                        system security plan annex. In addition, and as appropriate, security controls should
                        also be recorded in both the system’s incident response plan and continuous monitoring
                        plan.</p>

                     <p>Once suitable security controls have been identified and agreed upon for a system,

                     <p>In conducting a security assessment, it is important that assessors and system owners
                        first agree to the scope, type and extent of assessment activities, which may be documented
                        in a security assessment plan, such that any risks associated with the security assessment
                        can be appropriately managed. To a large extent, the scope of the security assessment
                        will be determined by the type of system and security controls that have been implemented
                        for the system and its operating environment.</p>
                     <p>For TOP SECRET systems, including sensitive compartmented information systems, security
                        assessments can be undertaken by ASD assessors (or their delegates). While for SECRET
                        and below systems, security assessments can be undertaken by an organisation’s own
                        assessors or Infosec Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) assessors. In all cases,
                        assessors should hold an appropriate security clearance and have an appropriate level
                        of experience and understanding of the type of system they are assessing.</p>
                     <p>At the conclusion of a security assessment, a security assessment report should be
                        produced outlining the scope of the security assessment, the system’s strengths and
                        weaknesses, security risks associated with the operation of the system, the effectiveness
                        of the implementation of security controls, and any recommended remediation actions.
                        This will assist in performing any initial remediation actions as well as guiding
                        the development of the system’s plan of action and milestones.</p>

                     <p>Authorise the system to operate based on the acceptance of the security risks associated
                        with its operation.</p>
                     <p>Before a system can be granted authorisation to operate, sufficient information should
                        be provided to the authorising officer in order for them to make an informed risk-based
                        decision as to whether the security risks associated with its operation are acceptable
                        or not. This information should take the form of an authorisation package that includes
                        the system’s system security plan, incident response plan, continuous monitoring plan,
                        security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones.</p>
                     <p>In some cases, the security risks associated with a system’s operation will be acceptable
                        and it will be granted authorisation to operate; however, in other cases the security
                        risks associated with operation of a system may be unacceptable. In such cases, the
                        authorising officer may request further work, and potentially another security assessment,
                        be undertaken by the system owner. In the intervening time, the authorising officer
                        may choose to grant authorisation to operate but with constraints placed on the system’s
                        use. Finally, if the authorising officer deems the security risks to be unacceptable
                        regardless of any potential constraints on the system’s use, they may deny authorisation
                        to operate until such time that sufficient remediation actions, if possible, have
                        been completed to an acceptable standard.</p>
                     <p>For TOP SECRET systems, and systems that process, store or communicate sensitive compartmented
                        information, the authorising officer is Director-General ASD or their delegate. While
                        for SECRET and below systems, the authorising officer is an organisation’s CISO or
                        their delegate.</p>
                     <p>For multinational and multi-organisation systems, the authorising officer should be
                        determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved. While for commercial
                        providers providing services to organisations, the authorising officer is the CISO
                        of the supported organisation or their delegate.</p>
                     <p>In all cases, the authorising officer should have an appropriate level of seniority
                        and understanding of security risks they are accepting on behalf of their organisation.
                        In cases where an organisation does not have a CISO, the authorising officer could
                        be a Chief Security Officer, a CIO or other senior executive within the organisation.</p>

                        to continue for a short period of time in order to understand its extent. Organisations
                        allowing a targeted cyber intrusion to continue on a system should establish with
                        their legal advisors whether the actions are breaching the <a href="#f0b5a766-fb46-4a50-b7a9-4a0544eb2296">Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979</a>.</p>

                     <p>Post-incident analysis after a targeted cyber intrusion can assist in determining
                        whether an adversary has been removed from a system. This can be achieved, in part,
                        by conducting a full network traffic capture for at least seven days. Organisations
                        should then be able to identify anomalous behaviour that may indicate whether the

                     <p>As part of cyber supply chain risk management activities, organisations should consider
                        the security risks that may arise as systems, software and hardware are being designed,
                        built, stored, delivered, installed, operated, maintained or decommissioned. This
                        includes identifying and managing jurisdictional, governance, privacy and security
                        risks associated with the use of suppliers and service providers. For example, outsourced
                        information technology or cloud services may be located offshore and subject to lawful
                        and covert data collection without their customers’ knowledge. Additionally, use of
                        offshore services introduces jurisdictional risks as foreign countries’ laws could
                        change with little warning. Finally, foreign owned service providers operating in
                        Australia may be subject to a foreign government’s lawful access to data belonging
                        to their customers.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, during the earliest possible stage of procurement processes, organisations
                        should consider the security risks that a particular supplier or service provider
                        may introduce to their systems. In doing so, it is important that organisations preference
                        suppliers and service providers that have demonstrated a commitment to secure-by-design
                        practices and have a strong track record of transparency and maintaining the security
                        of their own systems, services and cyber supply chains. Finally, in some cases, a
                        shared responsibly model which clearly defines the responsibilities of suppliers,
                        service providers and their customers can be highly beneficial.</p>

                        potentially delivering a superior service; however, it can also affect an organisation’s
                        security risk profile. Ultimately, organisations will still need to decide whether
                        a particular outsourced cloud service represents an acceptable risk and, if appropriate
                        to do so, authorise it for their own use.</p>
                     <p>Cloud service providers and their cloud services will need to undergo regular security
                        assessments to determine their security posture and security risks associated with
                        their use. Following an initial security assessment, subsequent security assessments
                        should focus on any new cloud services that are being offered as well as any security-related
                        changes that have occurred since the previous security assessment.</p>

                     <p>Obligations for protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data
                        are no different when using an outsourced information technology or cloud service
                        than using an in-house service. As such, contractual arrangements between an organisation
                        and a service provider should address how security risks will be managed. However,
                        in some cases an organisation may require information technology or cloud services
                        to be used before all security requirements have been implemented by the service provider.
                        In such cases, contractual arrangements should include appropriate timeframes for
                        the implementation of security requirements and break clauses if these are not achieved.</p>
                     <p>In addition, although data ownership resides with an organisation, this can become
                        less clear in some circumstances, such as when legal action is taken and a service
                        provider is asked to provide access to, or data from, their assets. To mitigate the
                        likelihood of data being unavailable or compromised, organisations can document the
                        types of data and its ownership through contractual arrangements.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, organisations may make the decision to move from their current service
                        provider for strategic, operational or governance reasons. This may include scenarios
                        such as changing to another service provider, moving to a different service with the
                        same service provider or moving back to an on-premises solution. In many cases, transferring
                        data and functionality between old and new services or systems will be desired. Service
                        providers can assist organisations by ensuring data is as portable as possible and
                        that as much data can be exported as possible. As such, data should be stored in a
                        documented format, preferably an open standard, noting that undocumented or proprietary
                        formats may make it more difficult for organisations to perform backup, service migration
                        or service decommissioning activities.</p>
                     <p>Finally, to ensure that organisations are given sufficient time to download their
                        data or move to another service provider should a service provider cease offering
                        a particular service, a one month notification period should be documented in contractual
                        arrangements.</p>

                     <p>To perform their contracted duties, service providers may need to access an organisation’s
                        systems and data. However, without proper security controls in place, this access
                        could leave organisations’ systems vulnerable – especially when such access occurs
                        from outside of Australian borders. As such, organisations should ensure that their
                        systems and data are not accessed or administered by service providers unless such
                        requirements, and associated measures to control such requirements, are documented
                        in contractual arrangements. In doing so, it is important that sufficient measures
                        are also in place to detect and record any unauthorised access, such as customer support
                        representatives or platform engineers accessing an organisation’s encryption keys.
                        In such cases, the service provide should immediately report the cyber security incident
                        to organisations and make available all logs pertaining to the unauthorised access.</p>

                        processes and procedures for systems. As such, it is important that they are developed
                        by personnel with a good understanding of security matters, the technologies being
                        used and the business requirements of the organisation.</p>

                        dynamic content such as wikis, intranets or other forms of document repositories.
                        Furthermore, depending on the documentation framework used, details common to multiple
                        systems could be consolidated into higher level security documentation.</p>

                     <p>A continuous monitoring plan can assist organisations in proactively identifying,
                        prioritising and responding to security vulnerabilities. Measures to monitor and manage
                        security vulnerabilities in systems can also provide organisations with a wealth of
                        valuable information about their exposure to cyber threats, as well as assisting them
                        to determine security risks associated with the operation of their systems. Undertaking
                        continuous monitoring activities is important as cyber threats and the effectiveness
                        of security controls will change over time.</p>
                     <p>Three types of continuous monitoring activities are vulnerability assessments, vulnerability
                        scans and penetration tests. A vulnerability assessment typically consists of a review
                        of a system’s architecture or an in-depth hands-on assessment while a vulnerability
                        scan involves using software tools to conduct automated scans. In each case, the goal
                        is to identify as many security vulnerabilities as possible. A penetration test however
                        is designed to exercise real-world targeted cyber intrusion scenarios in an attempt
                        to achieve a specific goal, such as compromising critical system components or data.
                        Regardless of the continuous monitoring activities chosen, they should be conducted
                        by suitably skilled personnel independent of the system being assessed. Such personnel
                        can be internal to an organisation or a third party. This ensures that there is no
                        conflict of interest, perceived or otherwise, and that the activities are undertaken
                        in an objective manner.</p>

                     <p>The application of defence-in-depth to the protection of systems is enhanced through
                        the use of successive layers of physical security. The first layer of security is
                        the use of Security Zones for a facility.</p>
                     <p>Deployable platforms should meet physical security requirements as per any other system.
                        Notably, physical security certification authorities dealing with deployable platforms
                        may have specific requirements that supersede the security controls in these guidelines.
                        As such, personnel should contact their physical security certification authority
                        to seek guidance.</p>
                     <p>In the case of deployable platforms, physical security requirements may also include
                        perimeter controls, building standards and manning levels.</p>

                     <p>While physical security can provide a degree of protection to data communicated over
                        network infrastructure, organisations can have reduced control over data when it is
                        communicated over network infrastructure in areas not authorised for the processing
                        of such data. For this reason, it is important that data communicated over network
                        infrastructure outside of areas in which it is authorised to be processed is appropriately
                        encrypted.</p>

                     <p>Adequate physical protection should be provided to network devices, especially those
                        in public areas, to prevent an adversary physically damaging a network device with
                        the intention of interrupting services.</p>
                     <p>Physical access to network devices can also allow an adversary to reset devices to
                        factory default settings by pressing a physical reset button, connecting a serial
                        interface to a device or connecting directly to a device to bypass any access controls.
                        Resetting a network device to factory default settings may disable security settings
                        on the device including authentication and encryption functions as well as resetting
                        administrator accounts and passwords to known defaults. Even if access to a network
                        device is not gained by resetting it, it is highly likely a denial of service will
                        occur.</p>
                     <p>Physical access to network devices can be restricted through methods such as physical
                        enclosures that prevent access to console ports and factory reset buttons, mounting
                        devices on ceilings or behind walls, or placing devices in locked rooms or cabinets.</p>

                     <p>Radio Frequency (RF) devices, such as mobile devices, wireless keyboards and Bluetooth
                        devices (e.g. keyboards, headphones and pointers), as well as infrared (IR) devices,
                        can pose a security risk to organisations, especially when they are capable of recording
                        or transmitting highly classified audio or data. In highly classified environments,
                        it is important that organisations understand the security risks associated with the
                        introduction of such devices and should maintain a register of those that have been
                        authorised for use in such environments.</p>
                     <p>In deciding which RF or IR devices to authorise to be brought into SECRET and TOP
                        SECRET areas, organisations may want to consider any existing mitigating measures
                        such as whether any IR communications would be prevented from travelling outside secured
                        spaces, whether systems of different sensitives or classifications are used in the
                        same spaces, and if any temporary or permanent method of blocking RF or IR transmissions

                     <p>ICT equipment and media needs to be secured when not in use. This can be achieved

                     <p>If none of the above approaches are feasible, organisation may wish to minimise the
                        potential impact of not securing ICT equipment when not in use. This can be achieved
                        by preventing sensitive or classified data from being stored on hard drives (e.g.
                        by storing user profiles and documents on network shares), removing temporary user
                        data at logoff, scrubbing virtual memory at shut down, and sanitising memory at shut
                        down. It should be noted though that there is no guarantee that such measures will
                        always work effectively or will not be bypassed due to circumstances such as an unexpected
                        loss of power. Therefore, hard drives in such cases will retain their sensitivity

                     <p>It is important that organisations do not lose access to systems. As such, organisations
                        should always have a method for gaining access during emergencies. Typically, such
                        emergencies would occur where access to systems cannot be gained via normal authentication
                        processes (e.g. due to misconfigurations of authentication services, misconfigurations
                        of security settings or due to a cyber security incident). In these situations, a
                        break glass account (also known as an emergency access account) can be used to gain
                        access. As break glass accounts generally have the highest level of privileges available
                        for systems, extreme care should be taken to both protect them and to monitor for
                        any signs of compromise or abuse.</p>
                     <p>When break glass accounts are used, actions undertaken will not be directly attributable
                        to an individual, and systems may not generate audit logs. As such, additional activities
                        need to be taken in order to ensure a system’s integrity. In doing so, organisations
                        should ensure that configuration changes made using a break glass account are identified
                        and documented using configuration management processes. This includes documenting
                        the individual using the break glass account, the reason for using the break glass
                        account and the reason for any configuration changes made to a system.</p>
                     <p>As the custodian of each break glass account should be the only party who knows the
                        account’s credentials, credentials will need to be changed and tested by custodians
                        after the authorised access by another party. Modern password managers that support
                        automated credential changes and testing can assist in reducing the administrative
                        overheads of such activities.</p>

                     <p>It is important to identify the need for emanation security controls for a system
                        early in the project life cycle as this can reduce costs for the project. Costs are
                        much greater if changes have to be made once the system has been designed and deployed.</p>

                     <p>During the time mobile devices are connected to the internet for web browsing they
                        are directly exposed to targeted cyber intrusions originating from the internet. Should
                        web browsing be required, best practice involves establishing a Virtual Private Network
                        (VPN) connection and browsing the web though an organisation’s internet gateway.</p>
                     <p>A split tunnel VPN can allow access to systems from another network, including unsecured
                        networks such as the internet. If split tunnelling is not disabled there is an increased
                        security risk that the VPN connection is susceptible to targeted cyber intrusions
                        from such networks. Disabling split tunnelling may not be achievable on all mobile
                        devices. Organisations can refer to the relevant ACSC guidance for mobile devices
                        on how to manage security risks associated with split tunnelling.</p>

                        an unevaluated product does not. To assist in providing this assurance, the Australian
                        Signals Directorate (ASD) performs product evaluations through the following programs:</p>
                     <p class="UNKNOWN bullet"><span class="tag">bullet: </span>ASD Cryptographic Evaluation (ACE) program, for products used to protect classified

                     <p>The Australian Certification Authority within the Australian Cyber Security Centre
                        (ACSC) also certifies product evaluations conducted by licensed commercial facilities,
                        in accordance with the Common Criteria, as part of the Australian Information Security
                        Evaluation Program (AISEP).</p>
                     <p>For organisations seeking to procure evaluated products, the Common Criteria’s <a href="#80093044-1885-4968-9a67-3762c15884bb">Certified Products List</a> contains a list of products that have been certified in accordance with the Common
                        Criteria. Alternatively, the ACSC can be contacted for information on products that
                        are either in-evaluation or have completed evaluation via the ACE program or the High

                     <p>A Protection Profile (PP) is a technology-specific document that defines the security
                        functions that must be included in a Common Criteria certified product to mitigate
                        specific cyber threats. PPs can be published by a recognised Common Criteria Recognition
                        Arrangement (CCRA) scheme or by the CCRA body itself. PPs published by the CCRA body
                        are referred to as collaborative PPs.</p>
                     <p>The ACSC recognises all PPs listed on the Common Criteria website in addition to those
                        listed on the ACSC’s website. Where a PP does not exist, an evaluation based on an
                        Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) may be accepted. Such evaluations are capped at EAL2+
                        as this represents the best balance between completion time and meaningful security
                        assurance gains.</p>

                     <p>Organisations choosing to use Common Criteria certified products can determine their
                        suitability by reviewing their evaluation documentation. This includes the security
                        target and certification report.</p>
                     <p>Products that are undergoing a Common Criteria evaluation will not have published
                        evaluation documentation. However, documentation can be obtained from the ACSC if
                        a product is being evaluated through the AISEP. For a product that is in evaluation
                        through a foreign scheme, the product’s vendor can be contacted directly for further
                        information.</p>

                     <p>It is important that organisations ensure that products they purchase are the actual
                        products that are delivered. In the case of evaluated products, if the product delivered
                        differs from an evaluated version then the assurance gained from the evaluation may
                        not necessarily apply.</p>
                     <p>Packaging and delivery practices can vary greatly from product to product. For most
                        evaluated products, standard commercial packaging and delivery practices are likely
                        to be sufficient. However, in some cases more secure packaging and delivery practices,
                        including tamper-evident seals and secure transportation, may be required. In the
                        case of the digital delivery of evaluated products, vendor-supplied checksums can
                        often be used to ensure the integrity of software that was delivered.</p>

                     <p>When disposing of ICT equipment, any media in the ICT equipment should be sanitised
                        in situ or removed and sanitised separately. Once any media has been sanitised or
                        removed, ICT equipment can be considered sanitised. As such, the ICT equipment can
                        then be declassified and formally authorised for release into the public domain. However,
                        if media cannot be sanitised or removed, the ICT equipment will need to be destroyed
                        in its entirety.</p>
                     <p>In addition, removing labels and markings indicating the classification, codewords,
                        caveats, owner, system or network details as part of the disposal process will ensure
                        ICT equipment does not display indications of its prior use and draw undue attention.</p>

                     <p>Since media is capable of storing sensitive or classified data, it is important that
                        a media management policy is developed and implemented to ensure that all types of
                        media, and the data it stores, is protected in an appropriate manner. In many cases,
                        an organisation’s media management policy will be closely tied to their removable
                        media usage policy.</p>

                     <p>Some operating systems provide functionality to automatically execute software that
                        resides on media. While this functionality was designed with a legitimate purpose
                        in mind (e.g. automatically loading a graphical user interface to browse the contents
                        of the media or to install software) it can also be used for malicious purposes. For
                        example, an adversary can create a file on media that the operating system believes
                        it should automatically execute. When the operating system executes the file, it can
                        have the same effect as when a user explicitly executes malicious code; however, in
                        this case the user is taken out of the equation as the operating system executes the
                        file without explicitly asking for permission.</p>
                     <p>Device access control software allows control over media that can be connected to
                        systems and how operating systems interact with it. For example, it can prevent data
                        from being read from media, software being executed from media and/or data being written
                        to media. Disabling connection ports in software can also assist in preventing operating
                        systems from interacting with media.</p>
                     <p>Media can be prevented from connecting to systems by physical means such as using
                        wafer seals or applying epoxy. If physical means are used to prevent media connecting
                        to systems, processes and procedures covering detection and reporting are needed in
                        order to respond to attempts to bypass these measures.</p>

                     <p>Organisations transferring data between systems belonging to different security domains
                        are strongly encouraged to use write-once media. When done properly (e.g. using non-rewritable
                        compact discs that have been finalised) this will ensure that data from the destination
                        system cannot be accidently transferred, or maliciously exfiltrated, onto the media
                        used for the data transfer and then onto another system, such as the original source
                        system. Alternatively, if suitable write-once media is not used, the destination system
                        should have a mechanism through which read-only access can be ensured (e.g. via a
                        read-only device or hardware write-blocker). However, the use of read-only mechanisms
                        is not immune to failure or compromise, therefore, rewritable media should still be
                        sanitised following each data transfer.</p>
                     <p>It is important to note that for PROTECTED and below non-volatile flash memory media
                        it will be possible to sanitise and reclassify the media after a data transfer to
                        allow it to be connected to lower classified systems again. This is not possible for
                        SECRET and above non-volatile flash memory media as the media cannot be reclassified
                        to a lower classification following sanitisation.</p>

                     <p>ICT equipment will often contain devices that are quite small and may not be immediately
                        recognisable as memory. Examples of these include M.2 or Mini-Serial Advanced Technology
                        Attachment (mSATA) devices. When sanitising M.2 or mSATA devices, the method for non-volatile
                        flash memory media sanitisation applies. Generally, if a device offers persistent
                        storage of data, it is likely that the method for non-volatile flash memory media
                        sanitisation will apply.</p>

                     <p>Published literature suggests that short-term remanence effects are likely in volatile
                        media. Data retention times have been reported to be measured in minutes at normal
                        room temperatures and up to hours in extreme cold. Furthermore, some volatile media
                        can suffer from long-term remanence effects resulting from physical changes to the
                        media due to continuous storage of static data for an extended period of time. It
                        is for these reasons that under certain circumstances TOP SECRET volatile media retains
                        its classification following sanitisation.</p>
                     <p>Typical circumstances preventing the reclassification of TOP SECRET volatile media
                        include a static cryptographic key being stored in the same memory location during
                        every boot of a device and a static image being displayed on a device and stored in
                        volatile media for a period of months.</p>

                     <p>Both the host-protected area and device configuration overlay table of non-volatile
                        magnetic media are normally not visible to an operating system or a computer’s basic
                        input/output system. Therefore, any sanitisation of the readable sectors of media
                        will not overwrite these hidden sectors leaving any data contained in these locations
                        untouched. Some sanitisation programs include the ability to reset media to their
                        default state removing any host-protected areas or device configuration overlays.
                        This allows the sanitisation program to see the entire contents of media during the
                        subsequent sanitisation process.</p>
                     <p>Modern non-volatile magnetic media automatically reallocates space for bad sectors
                        at a hardware level. These bad sectors are maintained in what is known as the growth
                        defects table or ‘g-list’. If data was stored in a sector that was subsequently added
                        to the g-list, sanitising the media will not overwrite these non-addressable bad sectors.
                        While these sectors may be considered bad by the media, quite often this is due to
                        the sectors no longer meeting expected performance norms and not due to an inability
                        to read/write to them. The Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) secure erase command
                        was built into the firmware of post-2001 media and is able to access sectors that
                        have been added to the g-list.</p>
                     <p>Modern non-volatile magnetic media also contain a primary defects table or ‘p-list’.
                        The p-list contains a list of bad sectors found during post-production processes.
                        No data is ever stored in sectors on the p-list as they are inaccessible before the
                        media is used for the first time.</p>

                     <p>Degaussing magnetic media changes the alignment of magnetic domains resulting in data
                        being permanently corrupted.</p>
                     <p>Coercivity (the resistance of magnetic material to change) varies between magnetic
                        media types and between brands and models of the same type of media. Care is needed
                        when degaussing magnetic media since a degausser of insufficient strength will not
                        be effective. The United States’ National Security Agency provides further information
                        on the common types of magnetic media and their associated coercivity ratings within
                        their list of evaluated degaussers.</p>
                     <p>Since 2006, perpendicular magnetic media has been available. As some degaussers are
                        only capable of sanitising longitudinal magnetic media, care needs to be taken to
                        ensure that a suitable degausser is used.</p>
                     <p>Finally, to ensure that degaussers are being used in the correct manner to achieve
                        an effective destruction outcome, product-specific directions provided by degausser
                        manufacturers should be followed.</p>

                     <p>Allowing users to setup, configure and maintain their own workstations or servers
                        can create an inconsistent environment where particular workstations or servers are
                        more vulnerable than others. This type of environment can easily allow an adversary
                        to gain an initial foothold on a network. A Standard Operating Environment (SOE) is
                        a standardised implementation of an operation system and applications and is designed
                        to ensure a consistent and secure baseline.</p>
                     <p>When SOEs are obtained from third parties, such as service providers, there are additional
                        supply chain risks that should be considered, such as the accidental or deliberate
                        inclusion of malicious content or configurations. To reduce the likelihood of such
                        occurrences, organisations should not only obtain their SOEs from trusted sources
                        but also scan them before use to ensure their integrity.</p>
                     <p>As the configuration of operating environments will naturally change over time (e.g.
                        patches are applied, configurations are changed, and applications are added or removed)
                        it is essential that SOEs are reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure that
                        an updated baseline is maintained.</p>

                        over older releases. This can make it more difficult for an adversary to craft reliable
                        exploits for security vulnerabilities they discover. Using older releases of operating
                        systems, especially those no longer supported by vendors, exposes organisations to
                        exploitation techniques that have since been mitigated in newer releases.</p>
                     <p>The x64 (64-bit) versions of Microsoft Windows include additional security functionality
                        that the x86 (32-bit) versions lack. Using x86 (32-bit) versions of Microsoft Windows
                        exposes organisations to exploitation techniques mitigated by x64 (64-bit) versions
                        of Microsoft Windows.</p>

                     <p>When operating systems are deployed in their default state it can easily lead to an
                        unsafe operating environment allowing an adversary to gain an initial foothold on
                        a network. Many options exist within operating systems to allow them to be configured
                        in a secure state to minimise this security risk. The Australian Cyber Security Centre
                        (ACSC) and vendors often produce hardening guides to assist in securely configuring
                        various operating systems.</p>

                     <p>While the ability to install any application may be a business requirement for users,
                        this privilege can be exploited by an adversary who can email a malicious application,
                        or host it on a compromised website, and use social engineering techniques to convince
                        users into installing it. Even if privileged access is required to install applications,
                        users will often use their privileged access if they believe, or can be convinced
                        that, the requirement to install the application is legitimate. Additionally, if applications
                        are configured to install using elevated privileges, an adversary can exploit this
                        by creating a Windows Installer installation package to create a new account that
                        belongs to the local administrators group. One way to manage this security risk is
                        to allow users to install vetted and approved applications from organisation-managed
                        software repositories or from trusted application marketplaces.</p>

                     <p>An adversary can email malicious code, or host malicious code on a compromised website,
                        and use social engineering techniques to convince users into executing it. Such malicious
                        code often aims to exploit security vulnerabilities in existing applications and does
                        not need to be installed to be successful. Application control can be an extremely
                        effective mechanism in not only preventing malicious code from executing, but also
                        ensuring only approved applications can be installed.</p>
                     <p>When developing application control rules, defining a list of approved executables
                        (e.g. .exe and .com files), software libraries (e.g. .dll and.ocx files), scripts
                        (e.g. .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .vbs and .js files), installers (e.g. .msi, .msp and .mst
                        files), compiled HTML (e.g. .chm), HTML applications (e.g. .hta), control panel applets
                        (e.g. .cpl) and drivers from scratch is a more secure method than relying on a list
                        of those currently residing on a workstation or server. Furthermore, it is preferable
                        that organisations define their own rulesets rather than relying on rulesets from
                        application control vendors.</p>

                     <p>PowerShell is a powerful scripting language developed by Microsoft to provide an integrated
                        interface for automated system administration, and is an important part of system
                        administrator toolkits due to its ubiquity and the ease with which it can be used
                        to fully control Microsoft Windows environments. However, it is also a dangerous exploitation
                        tool in the hands of an adversary. In order to prevent attacks leveraging security
                        vulnerabilities in earlier PowerShell versions, Windows PowerShell 2.0 functionality
                        should be removed from operating systems. Additionally, PowerShell’s language mode
                        should be set to Constrained Language Mode to achieve a balance between functionality
                        and security. Finally, logging functionality available in PowerShell, such as module
                        logging, script block logging and transcription, can provide invaluable information
                        for incident responders following cyber security incidents that involved PowerShell
                        being used for malicious purposes.</p>

                     <p>Many endpoint security solutions rely on signatures to detect malicious code. This
                        approach is only effective when a particular piece of malicious code has already been
                        profiled and signatures are current. Unfortunately, an adversary can create variants
                        of known malicious code, or develop new unseen malicious code, to bypass traditional
                        signature-based detection mechanisms. A Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)
                        can use behaviour-based detection schemes to assist in identifying and blocking anomalous
                        behaviour, such as process injection, keystroke logging, driver loading and call hooking,
                        as well as detecting malicious code that has yet to be identified by antivirus vendors.</p>

                     <p>Network firewalls often fail to prevent the propagation of malicious code on a network,
                        or an adversary from extracting important data, as they generally only control which
                        ports or protocols can be used between different network segments. Many forms of malicious
                        code are designed specifically to take advantage of this by using common protocols
                        such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, Simple Mail
                        Transfer Protocol and DNS. Software firewalls are more effective than network firewalls
                        as they can control which applications and services can communicate to and from workstations
                        and servers. The in-built Windows firewall should be used to control both inbound
                        and outbound traffic for specific applications.</p>

                     <p>When vendors develop software they may not use secure coding practices. An adversary
                        can take advantage of this by developing malicious code to exploit security vulnerabilities
                        that have not been detected and remedied. As significant time and effort is often
                        involved in developing functioning and reliable exploits, an adversary will often
                        reuse their exploits as much as possible. While exploits may be profiled by antivirus
                        vendors, they often remain a viable intrusion method in organisations that do not
                        have any measures in place to detect them.</p>

                     <p>When selecting applications it is important that organisations preference vendors
                        that have demonstrated a commitment to secure coding practices and have a strong track
                        record of maintaining the security of their applications. This will assist not only
                        with hardening applications but also increase the likelihood that vendors will release
                        timely patches to remediate any security vulnerabilities in their applications.</p>

                     <p>Newer versions of applications often introduce improvements in security functionality
                        over older versions. This can make it more difficult for an adversary to craft reliable
                        exploits for security vulnerabilities they discover. Using older versions of applications,
                        especially key business applications such as office productivity suites, web browsers
                        and their extensions, email clients, Portable Document Format (PDF) software, and
                        security products exposes organisations to exploitation techniques that have since
                        been mitigated in newer versions of applications.</p>

                     <p>By default, many applications enable functionality that is not required by users while
                        security functionality may be disabled or set at a lower security level. This is especially
                        risky for key business applications such as office productivity suites, web browsers
                        and their extensions, email clients, PDF software, and security products that are
                        likely to be targeted by an adversary. To assist in minimising this security risk,
                        the ACSC produces guidance to assist in securely configuring key business applications.
                        Further, to assist in securely configuring their applications, vendors may provide
                        their own security guides.</p>

                     <p>Microsoft Office files can contain embedded code (known as a macro) written in the
                        Visual Basic for Applications programming language. A macro can contain a series of
                        commands that can be coded or recorded, and replayed at a later time to automate repetitive
                        tasks. Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by users to greatly improve
                        their productivity. However, an adversary can also create macros to perform a variety
                        of malicious activities, such as assisting to compromise workstations in order to
                        exfiltrate or deny access to sensitive or classified data. To reduce this security
                        risk, organisations should disable Microsoft Office macros for users that do not have
                        a demonstrated business requirement and secure their use for the remaining users that
                        do.</p>

                     <p>Multi-factor authentication uses two or more authentication factors to confirm a user’s
                        identity. This may include:</p>
                     <p class="UNKNOWN bullet"><span class="tag">bullet: </span>something a user knows, such as a password</p>
                     <p class="UNKNOWN bullet"><span class="tag">bullet: </span>something a user has, such as a security key, smart card, mobile phone or physical
                        one-time password token</p>
                     <p class="UNKNOWN bullet"><span class="tag">bullet: </span>something a user is, such as a fingerprint or their facial geometry.</p>
                     <p>Note, however, that if something a user knows is written down, or typed into a file
                        and stored as plaintext, this becomes something that a user has rather than something
                        a user knows.</p>
                     <p>Privileged users, users of remote access solutions and users with access to important
                        data repositories are more likely to be targeted by an adversary due to their level
                        of access. For this reason, it is especially important that multi-factor authentication
                        is used for these accounts. In addition, multi-factor authentication is vital to any
                        system administration activities as it can limit the consequences of a compromise
                        by preventing or slowing an adversary’s ability to gain unrestricted access to assets.
                        In this regard, multi-factor authentication can be implemented as part of a jump server
                        authentication process where assets being administered do not support multi-factor
                        authentication.</p>
                     <p>When implementing multi-factor authentication, several different authentication factors
                        can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors, such as biometrics,
                        or codes sent via Short Message Service, Voice over Internet Protocol or email are
                        more susceptible to compromise than others. For this reason, a limited number of authentication
                        factors that involve something a user has is recommended for use as part of multi-factor
                        authentication implementations. Furthermore, for increased security, the use of verifier
                        impersonation resistant authentication factors are recommended to protect against
                        real-time phishing attacks.</p>
                     <p>The benefit of implementing multi-factor authentication can be diminished when credentials
                        are reused on other systems. For example, when usernames and passwords used as part
                        of multi-factor authentication for remote access are the same as those used for corporate
                        workstations. In such circumstances, if an adversary had compromised the device used
                        for remote access, they could capture the username and password for reuse against
                        a corporate workstation that did not require the use of multi-factor authentication.</p>

                     <p>A significant threat to the compromise of user accounts is offline password/passphrase
                        cracking tools. When an adversary gains access to a list of usernames and hashed passwords/passphrases
                        from a system, they can attempt to recover them by comparing the hash of a known password/passphrase
                        with the hashes from the list of hashed passwords/passphrases that they obtained.
                        By finding a match, an adversary will know the password/passphrase associated with
                        a given username. Combined, this often forms a complete set of credentials for an
                        account.</p>
                     <p>In order to reduce this security risk, organisations should implement multi-factor
                        authentication. Note, while single-factor authentication is no longer considered suitable
                        for protecting sensitive or classified data, it may not be possible to implement multi-factor
                        authentication on some systems. In such cases, organisations will need to increase
                        the time on average it takes an adversary to compromise a password/passphrase by introducing
                        complexity and continuing to increase its length over time. Such increases in length
                        can be balanced against useability through the use of passphrases rather than passwords.
                        In cases where systems don’t support passphrases, and as an absolute last resort,
                        the strongest password length and complexity supported by a system will need to be
                        implemented.</p>

                     <p>To provide additional security and credential management functionality for service
                        accounts, Microsoft introduced group Managed Service Accounts in Microsoft Windows
                        Server 2012. In doing so, service accounts that are created as group Managed Service
                        Accounts do not require manual credential management by administrators, as the operating
                        system automatically manages the credentials. This ensures that service account credentials
                        are not misplaced or forgotten, and that they are automatically changed on a regular
                        basis.</p>

                     <p>Locking an account after a specified number of failed logon attempts reduces the likelihood
                        of successful password spraying attacks. However, care should be taken as implementing
                        account lockout functionality can increase the likelihood of a denial of service.
                        Alternatively, some systems can be configured to automatically slowdown repeated failed
                        logon attempts rather than locking accounts. Implementing multi-factor authentication
                        is also an effective way of reducing the likelihood of successful password spraying
                        attacks.</p>

                        access and unauthorised modification. For example, Local Area Network (LAN) Manager
                        and NT LAN Manager authentication methods use weak hashing algorithms. As such, passwords/passphrases
                        used as part of LAN Manager authentication and NT LAN Manager authentication (i.e.
                        NTLMv1, NTLMv2 and NTLM2) can easily be compromised. Instead, organisations should
                        use Kerberos for authentication within Microsoft Windows environments.</p>

                     <p>Storing credentials with a system that it grants access to increases the likelihood
                        of an adversary gaining access to the system. For example, a password/passphrase should
                        never be written down and stuck to a laptop or computer monitor and security keys,
                        smartcards or one-time password tokens should never be left with computers or in laptop
                        bags. Furthermore, obscuring credentials as they are entered into systems can assist
                        in protecting them against screen scrapers and shoulder surfers.</p>
                     <p>If storing credentials on a system, sufficient protection should be implemented to
                        prevent them from being compromised as part of a targeted cyber intrusion. For example,
                        credentials can be stored in a password vault rather than in a Microsoft Word or Excel
                        document, credentials stored in a database can be hashed, salted and stretched, or
                        credentials can be stored in a hardware security module. In addition, security functionality,
                        such as Windows Defender Credential Guard and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard,
                        can be enabled to provide additional protection for credentials.</p>
                     <p>Finally, asymmetric authentication and secure transmission of credentials reduces
                        the likelihood of an adversary intercepting and using such credentials to access a
                        system under the guise of a valid user.</p>

                     <p>Containers allow for versatile deployment of systems, and can be used to quickly scale
                        systems. However, they are still systems that run software and should be treated as
                        any other system. Application of security controls in a containerised environment
                        may take a different form when compared to other types of systems. For example, patching
                        operating systems on workstations may be actioned differently to ensuring that a patched
                        image is being used for a container, however the principle is the same. In general,
                        the same security risks that apply to non-containerised systems would likely apply
                        to containerised systems.</p>

                     <p>Software-based isolation mechanisms are commonly used to share a physical server’s
                        hardware among multiple computing environments. The benefits of using software-based
                        isolation mechanisms to share a physical server’s hardware include increasing the
                        range of activities that it can be used for and maximising the utilisation of its
                        hardware.</p>
                     <p>A computing environment could consist of an entire operating system installed in a
                        virtual machine where the isolation mechanism is a hypervisor, as is commonly used
                        in cloud services providing Infrastructure as a Service. Alternatively, a computing
                        environment could consist of an application which uses the shared kernel of the underlying
                        operating system of the physical server where the isolation mechanisms are application
                        containers or application sandboxes, as is commonly used in cloud services providing
                        Platform as a Service. The logical separation of data within a single application,
                        which is commonly used in cloud services providing Software as a Service, is not considered
                        to be the same as multiple computing environments.</p>
                     <p>An adversary who has compromised a single computing environment, or who legitimately
                        controls a single computing environment, might exploit a misconfiguration or security
                        vulnerability in the isolation mechanism to compromise other computing environments
                        on the same physical server, or compromise the underlying operating system of the
                        physical server.</p>

                     <p>System administration of cloud services brings unique challenges when compared to
                        system administration of on-premise assets. Notably, responsibility for system administration
                        of cloud services is often shared between service providers and organisations. As
                        the technology stack and system administration processes implemented by service providers
                        are often opaque to organisations, organisations should consider a service provider’s
                        control plane to operate within a different security domain. As such, the security
                        controls below may require adjustment.</p>

                     <p>One of the greatest threats to the security of a network as a whole is the compromise
                        of the operating environment used for administration activities. Providing a separate
                        privileged operating environment for privileged users, in addition to their unprivileged
                        operating environment, provides greater assurance that privileged activities and credentials
                        will not be compromised.</p>
                     <p>Using different physical machines is considered the most secure solution to separate
                        privileged and unprivileged operating environments; however, a risk-based approach
                        may determine that a virtualisation-based solution is sufficient. In such cases, the

                     <p>Limiting the flow of management traffic to only network zones explicitly required
                        to communicate with each other can reduce the consequences of a network compromise
                        and make it easier to detect if it does occur. Furthermore, although user workstations

                        controllers in order to function, it is highly unlikely that they will need to send
                        or receive management traffic to these assets.</p>
                     <p>The following diagram outlines how management traffic filtering could be implemented

                     <p>A jump server (also known as a jump host or jump box) is used to manage resources
                        in a separate security domain. The use of jump servers as a form of management proxy
                        can be an effective way of simplifying and securing privileged activities. Implementing
                        a jump server can yield the following benefits:</p>

                     <p class="UNKNOWN bullet"><span class="tag">bullet: </span>a focal point for logging, monitoring and alerting.</p>
                     <p>In a typical scenario, if a privileged user wanted to perform administrative activities
                        they would connect directly to the target server using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
                        or Secure Shell (SSH). However, in a jump server setup (shown below), the privileged
                        user would first connect and authenticate to the jump server then RDP, SSH or use
                        remote administration tools to access the target server.</p>
                     <p></p>
                     <p>When implementing a jump server, it is recommended that organisations implement multi-factor
                        authentication, enforce strict device communication restrictions and harden administrative
                        infrastructure, otherwise a jump server will yield little security benefit.</p>

                  <p class="UNKNOWN subsection"><span class="tag">subsection: </span><p class="UNKNOWN subsectiontext"><span class="tag">subsectiontext: </span>When to patch security vulnerabilities</p>
                     <p>There are multiple information sources (such as news outlets, security researchers
                        and vendors) that organisations can use to assess the applicability and impact of
                        security vulnerabilities (such as if public exploit code is available or if the security
                        vulnerability is already being exploited by an adversary) in the context of their
                        environment.</p>
                     <p>Once a patch or update is released by a vendor, it should be applied in a timeframe
                        that is commensurate with the likelihood of targeting by an adversary in the context
                        of the organisation’s environment. Doing so ensures that resources are spent in an
                        effective and efficient manner by focusing effort on the most significant security
                        vulnerabilities first.</p>
                     <p>If a patch or update is released for high assurance ICT equipment, the ACSC will conduct
                        an assessment of the patch or update and may revise the ICT equipment’s usage guidance.
                        If a patch or update for high assurance ICT equipment is approved for deployment,
                        the ACSC will inform organisations of the timeframe in which it is to be deployed.</p>
                     <p>If no patches or updates are immediately available for security vulnerabilities, vendor
                        mitigations may provide the only effective protection until patches or updates become
                        available. These vendor mitigations may be published in conjunction with, or soon
                        after, security vulnerability announcements. Vendor mitigations may include disabling
                        the vulnerable functionality within the operating system, application or device, or
                        restricting or blocking access to the vulnerable service using firewalls or other
                        access controls.</p>

                     <p>To ensure that patches are applied consistently across an organisation’s workstation
                        and server fleet, it is essential that organisations use a centralised and managed

                     <p>Threat modelling is an important part of secure software design. Threat modelling
                        identifies at risk components of software, enabling security controls to be identified

                     <p>Software testing can lessen the risk of security vulnerabilities in software being
                        introduced into a production environment. Software testing can be performed using
                        both static testing, such as code analysis, as well as dynamic testing, such as input
                        validation and fuzzing. Vulnerability scanning tools can also assist in the detection
                        of known security vulnerabilities, such as out of date or vulnerable dependencies.
                        Using an independent party for software testing will remove any bias that can occur
                        when a software developer tests their own software.</p>

                     <p>Implementing a vulnerability disclosure program, based on responsible/coordinated
                        disclosure, can assist organisations, vendors and service providers to improve the
                        security of their products and services as it provides a way for security researchers,
                        customers and members of the public to responsibly notify them of potential security
                        vulnerabilities in a coordinated manner. Furthermore, following the verification and
                        resolution of a reported security vulnerability, it can assist organisations, vendors
                        and service providers in notifying their customers of any security vulnerabilities
                        that have been discovered in their products and services and any recommended security
                        patches, updates or mitigations.</p>
                     <p>A vulnerability disclosure program should include processes to receive, verify, resolve
                        and report on security vulnerabilities disclosed by both internal and external sources.
                        In support of this, a vulnerability disclosure policy should be made publicly available
                        that covers:</p>

                     <p>Finally, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) encourages security researchers,
                        customers and members of the public to responsibility report security vulnerabilities
                        directly with organisations, vendors and service providers. However, the ACSC recognises
                        that this is not always practical, initial attempts at communication may be unsuccessful
                        or the person making the report may not wish to do so directly. In such cases, security
                        vulnerabilities can be reported to the ACSC as an independent coordinator.</p>

                     <p>If DBMS software operating as a local administrator or root account is compromised
                        by an adversary, it can present a significant security risk to the underlying operating
                        system.</p>
                     <p>DBMS software is also often capable of accessing files that it has read access to
                        on the database server. For example, an adversary using an SQL injection could use
                        the command LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ‘etc/passwd’ INTO TABLE Users or SELECT load_file(“/etc/passwd”)
                        to access the contents of a Linux password file. Disabling the ability of the DBMS
                        software to read local files from a server will prevent such SQL injection from succeeding.
                        This could be performed, for example, by disabling use of the ‘LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE’
                        command.</p>

                     <p>DBMS software often comes pre-configured with default database administrator accounts
                        and passphrases that are listed in vendor documentation. These default database administrator
                        accounts should be disabled, renamed or have their passphrases changed.</p>
                     <p>When sharing database administrator accounts for the performance of administrative
                        activities, any actions undertaken will not be attributable to an individual database
                        administrator. This can hinder investigations relating to an attempted, or successful,
                        targeted cyber intrusion. Furthermore, database administrator accounts shared across
                        different databases can exacerbate any compromise of a database administrator account
                        by an adversary.</p>
                     <p>When creating new database administrator accounts, the accounts are often allocated

                        store or communicate lessens the chance of users inadvertently over-classifying an
                        email. This also serves to remind users of the maximum sensitivity or classification

                        will help email content filters prevent emails being sent to systems that are not
                        authorised to handle the original sensitivity or classification of the email.</p>

                     <p>Emails can be intercepted anywhere between originating email servers and destination
                        email servers. Enabling Transport Layer Security (TLS) on email servers will mitigate
                        the compromise of email traffic, with the exception of cryptanalysis of email traffic.</p>
                     <p>Implementing opportunistic TLS encryption can protect email traffic while ensuring
                        email servers remain compatible with other email servers due to the use of opportunistic
                        TLS encryption. However, opportunistic TLS for email is susceptible to downgrade attacks.
                        Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) allows domain owners to indicate
                        to other email servers that emails should only be sent if satisfactory TLS encryption
                        is negotiated prior to transfer.</p>
                     <p>Implementing MTA-STS reduces the opportunity for downgrade attacks during email transfer
                        and provides email server operators with visibility when downgrade attacks are attempted.
                        TLS reporting supports the implementation of MTA-STS by providing a mechanism for
                        a domain owner to publish a location where other email server operators can submit
                        reports about their success or failure trying to initiate encrypted sessions when
                        sending email to the specified domain.</p>

                     <p>It is important that network documentation accurately depicts the current state of
                        a network. This typically includes network devices such as firewalls, data diodes,
                        intrusion detection and prevention systems, routers, switches, and critical servers
                        and services. Furthermore, as this documentation could be used by an adversary to
                        assist in compromising a network, it is important that it is appropriately protected.</p>

                     <p>Network segmentation and segregation is one of the most effective security controls
                        to prevent an adversary from propagating through a network and accessing target data
                        after they have gained initial access. Technologies to enforce network segmentation
                        and segregation also contain logging functionality that can be valuable in detecting
                        an intrusion and, in the event of a compromise, isolating compromised devices from
                        the rest of a network.</p>
                     <p>Network segmentation and segregation involves separating a network into multiple functional
                        network zones with a view to protecting important data and critical services. For
                        example, one network zone may contain user workstations while another network zone
                        contains authentication servers. Network segmentation and segregation also assists
                        in the creation and maintenance of network access control lists.</p>

                     <p>Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) can be used to implement network segmentation

                     <p>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) functionality can introduce additional security
                        risks to a network. As such, disabling IPv6 functionality until it is intended to
                        be used will minimise the attack surface of the network and ensure that any IPv6 functionality
                        that is not intended to be used cannot be exploited.</p>
                     <p>To aid in the transition from Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) to IPv6, numerous
                        tunnelling protocols have been developed that are designed to allow interoperability
                        between the protocols. Disabling IPv6 tunnelling protocols on network devices and
                        ICT equipment that do not explicitly require such functionality will prevent an adversary
                        bypassing traditional network defences by encapsulating IPv6 data inside IPv4 packets.</p>
                     <p>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is a method of stateless Internet Protocol
                        (IP) address configuration in IPv6 networks. SLAAC reduces the ability of an organisation
                        to maintain effective logs of IP address assignment on a network. For this reason,
                        stateless IP addressing should be avoided.</p>

                     <p>If an adversary has limited opportunities to connect to a network, they have limited
                        opportunities to compromise that network. Network access controls not only prevent
                        unauthorised access to a network but also prevent users carelessly connecting a network
                        to another network.</p>
                     <p>Network access controls are also useful in segregating data for specific users with
                        a need-to-know or limiting the flow of data between network segments. For example,

                     <p>Inbound network connections from anonymity networks (such as Tor, Tor2web and I2P)
                        to an organisation’s internet-facing services can be used by adversaries for reconnaissance
                        and malware delivery purposes with minimal risk of detection and attribution. As such,
                        this traffic should be blocked provided it will not meaningfully impact accessibility
                        for legitimate users. For example, some organisations might choose to support anonymous
                        connections to their websites to cater for individuals who want to remain anonymous
                        for privacy reasons. In such cases, it is suggested that traffic from anonymity networks
                        be logged and monitored instead. Additionally, outbound network connections to anonymity
                        networks can be used by malware for command and control or data exfiltration and should
                        be blocked given they rarely have legitimate business uses.</p>

                     <p>Some wireless access points and wireless devices come with a default Service Set Identifier
                        (SSID) and/or weak default configuration settings. As the default SSIDs of wireless
                        access points are often documented in internet forums, along with default accounts
                        and passphrases, it is important to change the default SSID of wireless access points
                        along with default passphrases and weak configuration settings for all wireless devices.</p>
                     <p>When changing the default SSID, it is important that the new SSID does not bring undue
                        attention to an organisation’s wireless network. In doing so, the SSID of a wireless
                        network should not be readily associated with an organisation, the location of their
                        premises or the functionality of the wireless network.</p>
                     <p>A method commonly recommended to lower the profile of a wireless network is disabling
                        SSID broadcasting. While this ensures that the existence of the wireless networks
                        is not broadcast overtly using beacon frames, the SSID is still broadcast in probe
                        requests, probe responses, association requests and re-association requests. As such,
                        it is easy to determine the SSID of the wireless network by capturing these requests
                        and responses. By disabling SSID broadcasting, organisations will make it more difficult
                        for users to connect to a wireless network. Furthermore, an adversary could configure
                        a malicious wireless access point to broadcast the same SSID as the hidden SSID used
                        by a legitimate wireless network, thereby fooling users or devices into automatically
                        connecting to the adversary’s malicious wireless access point instead. In doing so,
                        the adversary could steal authentication credentials in order to gain access to the
                        legitimate wireless network. For these reasons, it is recommended organisations enable
                        SSID broadcasting.</p>

                        of secured spaces, all wireless network traffic requires suitable cryptographic protection.
                        For this purpose it is recommended that Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) be used as
                        it provides equivalent or greater security than its predecessor Wi-Fi Protected Access
                        2 (WPA2). WPA3 has also prohibited the use of various outdated and insecure cipher
                        suites.</p>
                     <p>WPA3-Enterprise supports three enterprise modes of operation: enterprise only mode,

                        as this mode incorporates changes that satisfy Commercial National Security Algorithm

                     <p>WPA3-Enterprise uses 802.1X authentication which requires the use of an Extensible
                        Authentication Protocol (EAP). A number of EAP methods supported by both WPA2 and
                        WPA3 are available.</p>
                     <p>Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) is considered
                        one of the most secure EAP methods and is widely supported. It uses a Public Key Infrastructure
                        (PKI) to secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial-In User Service
                        (RADIUS) server through the use of X.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides strong
                        mutual authentication, it requires an organisation to have established a PKI. This
                        involves deploying their own certificate authority and issuing certificates, or purchasing
                        certificates from a commercial certificate authority, for every device that accesses
                        the wireless network. While this introduces additional costs and management overheads,

                     <p>When issuing a certificate to a device in order to access a wireless network, organisations
                        should be aware that it could be stolen by malicious code. Once compromised, the certificate
                        could be used on other devices to gain unauthorised access to the wireless network
                        it was issued for. Organisations should also be aware that in only issuing a certificate
                        to a device, any actions taken by a user will only be attributable to a device and
                        not a specific user.</p>
                     <p>When issuing a certificate to a user in order to access a wireless network, it can
                        be in the form of a certificate that is stored on a device or a certificate that is
                        stored within a smart card. Issuing certificates on smart cards provides increased
                        security, but at a higher cost. Specifically, a user is more likely to notice a missing
                        smart card and alert their security team, who are then able to revoke the credentials
                        on the RADIUS server, which can minimise the time an adversary has access to the wireless
                        network. In addition, to reduce the likelihood of a stolen smart card from being used
                        to gain unauthorised access to a wireless network, multi-factor authentication can
                        be implemented through the use of personal identification numbers on smart cards.
                        This is particularly important when a smart card grants a user any form of administrative
                        access.</p>

                     <p>When 802.1X authentication is used, a shared secret key known as the Pairwise Master
                        Key (PMK) is generated upon successful authentication of a device. This PMK is then
                        capable of being cached to assist with fast roaming between wireless access points.
                        When a device roams away from a wireless access point that it has authenticated to,
                        it will not need to perform a full re-authentication should it roam back while the
                        cached PMK remains valid. To further assist with roaming, wireless access points can
                        be configured to pre-authenticate a device to other neighbouring wireless access points
                        that the device might roam to. Although requiring full authentication for a device
                        each time it roams between wireless access points is ideal, organisations can choose
                        to use PMK caching and pre-authentication if they have a business requirement for
                        fast roaming. If PMK caching is used, the PMK caching period should not be set to
                        greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours).</p>

                        FT is a feature designed to improve user mobility and combat lag introduced by the
                        need to authenticate to each wireless access point. However, FT requires authenticators
                        to request and send keys to other authenticators within a security domain. If any

                        imperative that communications are appropriately secured. As such, FT should be disabled

                        To protect credentials communicated between authenticators and a RADIUS server, communications

                     <p>An effective denial of service can be performed by exploiting unprotected management
                        frames using inexpensive commercial hardware. The 802.11 standard provides no protection
                        for management frames and therefore does not prevent spoofing or denial of service
                        activities. However, the 802.11w amendment specifically addresses the protection of
                        management frames on wireless networks and should be enabled for WPA2, in WPA3 this
                        feature is built into the standard.</p>

                     <p>Instead of deploying a small number of wireless access points that broadcast on high
                        power, a greater number of wireless access points that use less broadcast power can
                        be deployed to achieve the desired footprint. This has the benefit of providing service
                        continuity should a wireless access point become unserviceable. In such a case, the
                        output power of nearby wireless access points can be increased to cover the footprint
                        gap until the unserviceable wireless access point can be replaced.</p>
                     <p>In addition to minimising the output power of wireless access points to reduce the
                        footprint of a wireless network, the use of Radio Frequency (RF) shielding can be
                        used for an organisation’s premises. While expensive, this will limit the wireless
                        communications to areas under the control of an organisation. RF shielding on an organisation’s
                        premises has the added benefit of preventing the jamming of wireless networks from
                        outside of the premises in which wireless networks are operating.</p>

                     <p>Using a cloud service provider can allow an organisation to build highly resilient
                        online services due to the increased computing resources, bandwidth and multiple separate
                        physical sites made available by the cloud provider. Organisations can achieve the
                        same results using their own infrastructure; however, this may require significant
                        upfront costs and may still result in a limited capability to scale dynamically to
                        meet increased demand. In case of a denial-of-service attack, cloud-based hosting
                        can also provide segregation from self-hosted or other cloud hosted services ensuring
                        that other systems, such as email services, are not affected.</p>

                     <p>It is important that the connectivity between organisations and their cloud service
                        providers meets organisational requirements for bandwidth, latency and reliability.
                        To support this, organisations and cloud service providers should discuss and document
                        any specific network requirements, performance characteristics or planned responses
                        to availability failures, especially when requirements for high availability exist.
                        This includes whether network connections between organisations and cloud service
                        providers will use dedicated communication links, or connect over the internet, and
                        whether any secondary communications links will provide sufficient capacity to maintain
                        operational requirements should the primary communication link become unavailable.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, capacity monitoring should be performed in order to manage workloads
                        and monitor the health of online services. This can be achieved through continuous
                        and real-time monitoring of metrics such as latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput
                        and availability. In addition, feedback should be provided to cloud service providers
                        when performance does not meet service level agreement targets. To assist with this,
                        anomaly detection can be performed through network telemetry that is integrated into
                        security monitoring tools.</p>

                     <p>Similar to cloud-based hosting, the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) and denial
                        of service mitigation services can allow an organisation to create highly resilient
                        online services by leveraging the large bandwidth, geographically dispersed hosting
                        locations, traffic scrubbing and other security controls offered by CDN and denial
                        of service mitigation service providers.</p>
                     <p>The use of CDNs is particularly effective when serving static, bandwidth intensive
                        media such as images, sound or video files. However, the services offered by a CDN
                        can include more than basic content hosting such as web response caching, load balancing,
                        web application security controls or denial of service mitigations.</p>
                     <p>Care should be taken when configuring the use of a CDN or denial of service mitigation
                        service to ensure that the IP address of the organisation’s web server is not identifiable
                        by an adversary as this could allow for protections to be bypassed. Additionally,
                        appropriate network security controls should be applied to only allow communication
                        between an organisation’s server, the CDN or denial of service mitigation service
                        provider and the authorised management environment.</p>

                     <p>Denial-of-service attacks are designed to disrupt or degrade online services such

                     <p>Although an organisation cannot avoid being targeted by denial-of-service attacks,
                        there are a number of measures they can implement to prepare for and potentially reduce
                        the impact if targeted. This includes engaging with their cloud service providers
                        to identify the denial of service detection technologies that may be available for
                        use. For example, real-time capacity reporting dashboards, that provide out-of-band
                        and real-time alerts based on organisation-defined thresholds, can assist with the
                        rapid identification of denial-of-service attacks. In addition, not all online services
                        or functionality offered by an organisation may be business critical. Understanding
                        what services can be offered with reduced functionality, deprioritised, disabled or
                        lived without can help an organisation reduce or eliminate the impact on other more
                        essential services or free up resources to respond to more critical services first.</p>
                     <p>Overall, preparing for denial-of-service attacks before they occur is by far the best
                        strategy as it is very difficult to respond once they begin and efforts at this stage
                        are unlikely to be effective.</p>

                     <p>The purpose of cryptography is to provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication
                        and non-repudiation of data. Confidentiality protects data by making it unreadable
                        to all but authorised users, integrity protects data from accidental or deliberate
                        manipulation, authentication ensures that a person or entity is who they claim to
                        be, and non-repudiation provides proof that a user performed an action and prevents
                        them from denying that they did so.</p>

                     <p>Encryption of data at rest can be used to reduce the handling requirements for ICT
                        equipment and media while encryption of data in transit can be used to provide protection
                        for sensitive or classified data communicated over public network infrastructure.</p>
                     <p>When organisations use encryption for data at rest, or data in transit, they are not
                        reducing the sensitivity or classification of data. However, as the data is encrypted,
                        the consequences of the encrypted data being accessed by an adversary is considered
                        to be less. Therefore, handling requirements applied to the encrypted data can be
                        reduced. As the sensitivity or classification of the unencrypted data does not change,
                        additional layers of encryption cannot be used to further lower physical and handling
                        requirements.</p>

                        be used for the protection of highly classified data if they are suitably implemented

                     <p>There is no guarantee of an algorithm’s resistance against currently unknown attacks.
                        However, the algorithms listed in this section have been extensively scrutinised by
                        industry and academic communities in a practical and theoretical setting and have
                        not been found to be susceptible to any feasible attacks. There have been some cases
                        where theoretically impressive security vulnerabilities have been found; however,
                        these results are not of practical application.</p>
                     <p>AACAs fall into three categories: asymmetric/public key algorithms, hashing algorithms
                        and symmetric encryption algorithms.</p>
                     <p>The approved asymmetric/public key algorithms are:</p>
                     <p class="UNKNOWN bullet"><span class="tag">bullet: </span>Diffie-Hellman (DH) for agreeing on encryption session keys</p>
                     <p class="UNKNOWN bullet"><span class="tag">bullet: </span>Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) for digital signatures</p>

                        keys or similar keys.</p>
                     <p>The approved hashing algorithm is Secure Hashing Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) (i.e. SHA-224,
                        SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512).</p>
                     <p>The approved symmetric encryption algorithms are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
                        using key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits, and Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)
                        using three distinct keys.</p>
                     <p>Where there is a range of key sizes for an algorithm, some of the smaller key sizes
                        are not approved as they do not provide an adequate safety margin against possible
                        future attacks. For example, advances in integer factorisation methods could render
                        smaller RSA moduli vulnerable.</p>

                     <p>If cryptographic equipment or software implements unapproved algorithms, as well as
                        AACAs, it is possible that these unapproved algorithms could be used without a user’s
                        knowledge. In combination with an assumed level of security confidence, this can represent
                        a security risk. As such, organisations can ensure that only the AACA can be used
                        by disabling the unapproved algorithms (which is preferred) or advising users not
                        to use the unapproved algorithms via usage policies.</p>

                     <p>DH and DSA are vulnerable to different attacks than ECDH and ECDSA. As a result, ECDH
                        and ECDSA offer more effective security per bit increase. This leads to smaller data
                        requirements which in turn means that elliptic curve variants have become de facto
                        global standards. For reduced data cost, and to promote interoperability, ECDH and
                        ECDSA should be used when possible.</p>

                     <p>The use of Electronic Codebook Mode with block ciphers allows repeated patterns in
                        plaintext to appear as repeated patterns in ciphertext. Most plaintext, including

                     <p>Using three distinct keys for 3DES is deemed the only secure option for practical
                        purposes. All other keying options are susceptible to attacks that reduce the security
                        of 3DES and are therefore not deemed secure. Where practical, organisations should
                        use an approved implementation of AES, instead of 3DES.</p>

                     <p>SSH version 1 was found to have a number of security vulnerabilities. As such, it
                        was replaced by SSH version 2. A number of security risks also exist when SSH is configured
                        in an insecure manner. For example, forwarding connections and access privileges,
                        using host-based authentication, and permitting system administrator logins. The configuration
                        settings below are based on OpenSSH. Organisations using other implementations of
                        SSH should adapt these settings to suit their SSH implementation.</p>

                     <p>IPsec contains two major protocols, Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security
                        Payload (ESP). In order to provide a secure Virtual Private Network style connection,
                        both authentication and encryption are needed. AH and ESP can provide authentication
                        for the entire IP packet and the payload respectively. However, ESP is generally preferred
                        for authentication since AH by its nature has network address translation limitations.

                     <p>A Cross Domain Solution (CDS) is a system comprising security-enforcing functions
                        tailored to mitigate the specific security risks of accessing or transferring data
                        between security domains. A CDS may be an integrated appliance or, more commonly,
                        be composed of discrete technologies or sub-systems, with each sub-system consisting
                        of hardware and/or software components.</p>
                     <p>This section describes the security controls applicable to a CDS and extends upon
                        the security controls within the prior gateways section which are also applicable.
                        Furthermore, the <a href="#a6bbe0de-9528-4257-9d75-a8e71501a758">Guidelines for Data Transfers</a> is also applicable to a CDS. Finally, additional sections of these guidelines should
                        be consulted depending on the specific type of CDS deployed.</p>
                     <p>Personnel involved in the planning, analysis, design, implementation or assessment
                        of a CDS should refer to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)’s <a href="#db65bd48-2bcb-4707-b337-9d6dd7d73d68">Introduction to Cross Domain Solutions</a> and <a href="#1de20c0d-27b9-4565-91aa-f9e5219b11dd">Fundamentals of Cross Domain Solutions</a> publications.</p>

                     <p>These guidelines define two logical types of CDS: a Transfer CDS and an Access CDS.
                        These logical definitions are more closely aligned with how a CDS is described and
                        sold by vendors and system integrators. Vendors may also offer a combined Access and
                        Transfer solution.</p>
                     <p>Regardless of logical configuration, the underlying mechanisms in each CDS will consist
                        of a low to high data transfer path, a high to low data transfer path, or both. Data
                        filtering and other security controls are then applied to mitigate threats applicable
                        to the system’s operating context, including specific data paths and business cases.</p>
                     <p>A Transfer CDS facilitates the transfer of data, in one (unidirectional) or multiple
                        (bi-directional) directions between different security domains.</p>
                     <p></p>
                     <p>An Access CDS provides the user with access to multiple security domains from a single
                        device. Conceptually, an Access CDS allows remote interaction with one or multiple
                        systems in a different security domain, such as a ‘virtual desktop’, and does not
                        allow users to move data between security domains.</p>

                        one of the most common data delivery and exfiltration techniques used by an adversary.
                        However, if users have a legitimate requirement to access numerous websites, or a
                        rapidly changing list of websites, organisations should consider the costs of such
                        an implementation.</p>
                     <p>Even a relatively permissive list of allowed websites offers better security than

                        reducing implementation costs. An example of a permissive list could be the entire
                        Australian subdomain, that is ‘*.au’, or the top 1,000 websites from the Alexa website
                        ranking (after filtering Dynamic Domain Name System domains and other inappropriate

                        not pass between different security domains. As such, the level of assurance needed
                        in a peripheral switch is determined by the difference in sensitivity or classification
                        of systems connected to the switch.</p>
                     <p>There is no requirement for an evaluated peripheral switch when all connected systems
                        belong to the same security domain.</p>
